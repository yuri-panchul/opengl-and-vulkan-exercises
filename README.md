My elementary OpenGL and Vulkan exercises to understand the software side of GPU

## 2023.09.09

* Downloaded [tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://open.gl).

* Installed C++ compiler, GLEW and GLFW in Simply Linux by doing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-c++
sudo apt-get install libGLEW-devel
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-devel
```

* Created a rudimentary program that uses GLEW and GLFW, as well as a script to run it.
