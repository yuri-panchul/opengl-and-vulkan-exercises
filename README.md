# opengl-and-vulkan-exercises
My elementary OpenGL and Vulkan exercises to understand the software side of GPU

## 2023.09.09

* Downloaded [tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://open.gl).

* Installed C++ compiler, GLEW and GLFW in Simply Linux by doing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-c++ libGLEW-devel libglfw3-devel
```

* Created a rudimentary program that uses GLEW and GLFW, as well as a script to run it.

* Installed GLEW and GLFW in Lubuntu by doing:

```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev
```

## 2025.04.04

Made an option to use GLEW and GLFW without installing them with sudo, just by copying their files into ~/opengl.
