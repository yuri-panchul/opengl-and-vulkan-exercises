My elementary OpenGL and Vulkan exercises to understand the software side of GPU

* Downloaded [tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://open.gl).

* Installed C++ compiler, GLEW and GLFW in Simply Linux by doing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-c++ libGLEW-devel libglfw3-devel
```

* Created a rudimentary program that uses GLEW and GLFW, as well as a script to run it.

* Installed GLEW and GLFW in Lubuntu by doing:

```bash
sudo apt install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
```

Made an option to use GLEW and GLFW without installing them with sudo, just by copying their files into ~/opengl.

* Installed GLEW and GLFW in MacOS by doing:

brew install glew glfw

* Started adding examples based on [https://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Superbible-Comprehensive-Tutorial-Reference/dp/0672337479](OpenGL Superbible: Comprehensive Tutorial and Reference 7th Edition by Graham Sellers, Richard Wright Jr. and Nicholas Haemel).
